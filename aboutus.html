                Asmibooks is a for-profit, socially conscious business and a global online bookseller that collects and sells new and used books online,
                matching each purchase with a book donation. Each sale generates funds for literacy and education initiatives in the U.S. and around the world. Since its launch in 2000,
                Asmibooks has raised $33 million for libraries and literacy, donated over 32 million books, and reused or recycled more than 397 million books.
                Doing good is at the heart of Better World Books, but our customers make it all possible. Here are some of the ways our customers enable Better World Books to make a difference one book at a time.
                Our Annual Literacy Grants fund literacy and educational nonprofits and libraries for specific projects â€” the front lines of the fight to reduce global poverty through education. 
                Libraries and educational nonprofit literacy groups can apply for funds to support their efforts to further literacy in their communities. We carefully review each application ahead of awarding grants to projects that will have the greatest impact.
